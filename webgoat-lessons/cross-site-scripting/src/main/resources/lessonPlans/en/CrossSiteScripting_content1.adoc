== What is XSS

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end userâ€™s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.

=== XSS has a significant impact

Especially as 'Rich Internet Applications' are more and more common place, privileged function calls linked to via javascript may be compromised.
And if not properly protected, sensitive data (such as your authentication cookies) can be stolen and used for someone else's purpose.


==== Quick examples:
* From the browser address bar (chrome, Firefox)
+
----
javascript:alert("XSS Test");
javascript:alert(document.cookie);
----
* Any data field that is returned to the client is potentially injectable
+
----
<script>alert("XSS Test")</script>
----

== Try It!  Using Chrome or Firefox 

* Open a second tab and use the same url as this page you are currently on (or any url within this instance of WebGoat)
* Then, in the address bar on each tab, type `javascript:alert(document.cookie);` *NOTE:* If you /cut/paste you'll need to add the `javascript:` back in.
